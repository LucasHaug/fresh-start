This setup also uses the following gnome extensions:
- [Pop Shell](https://github.com/pop-os/shell)
- [Blur my Shell](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3193/blur-my-shell/)
- [Clipboard History](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4839/clipboard-history/)
- [Vitals](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1460/vitals/)
- [Aylur's Widgets](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5338/aylurs-widgets/)

The wallpaper and user image where obtained in the [nordic-wallpapers](https://github.com/linuxdotexe/nordic-wallpapers) respository.

Due to lack of discord support to Wayland, another discord client was used, the [WebCord](https://github.com/SpacingBat3/WebCord).

To configure discord [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal) may be used along with [wal-discor](https://github.com/guglicap/wal-discord) and [BeautifulDiscord](https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord), using the system wallpaper to get the color palette with pywal.

To configure Spotify, it may be used the [spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli) and the [Sleek + Cherry](https://github.com/morpheusthewhite/spicetify-themes/tree/master/Sleek) theme.
